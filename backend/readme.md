# Deepfake Detection and Blockchain Certification System

## Project Name

üéì **Unmask**

## Tagline

üîç _Ensuring Media Authenticity in the Age of Deepfakes_

## Description

Unmask is a cutting-edge service that combines advanced AI for deepfake detection with blockchain technology to provide tamper-proof certification of media authenticity. Users can upload media files such as images, videos, or audio, and the system will analyze them to detect any signs of manipulation or deepfakery. If the media is verified as authentic, a digital certificate of authenticity is generated and stored on the blockchain. Users can pay for this service using cryptocurrency.

## Problem It Solves

In an era where synthetic media and deepfake technology are becoming increasingly prevalent, distinguishing between real and manipulated visual content is a critical challenge. DeepCertify addresses this issue by providing a reliable and accessible tool for detecting deepfakes and issuing verifiable certificates. This service empowers users to make informed decisions about the credibility of multimedia content, thereby enhancing trust in digital media.

## Use Cases

- **Social Media Verification:** Users can verify the authenticity of media by forwarding it to the WhatsApp bot or sending the link to our website.
- **Journalism and News:** Journalists and news organizations can authenticate media before publishing, maintaining credibility and trustworthiness.
- **Legal Evidence:** Legal professionals can use the service to verify the authenticity of digital evidence, ensuring its admissibility in court.
- **Personal Use:** Individuals can verify personal photos or videos, such as those used in online dating or professional profiles.


## Key Features

- **Deepfake Detection AI:** Uses advanced AI models (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) to detect deepfakes and provides a confidence score for media authenticity.
- **Blockchain Certification:** Implements blockchain (Polygon zkEVM test network) for tamper-proof certificate storage and generates certificates post-verification.
- **Cryptocurrency Payment System:** Integrates Ethereum for payment of service fees and enables secure, user-friendly transactions.
- **User Interface:** An intuitive web-based application for uploading media files and obtaining blockchain-backed certificates.

## Challenges We Ran Into

During the development of Unmask, we encountered a version dependency error while installing the requirements for the deep learning model. This issue was resolved by providing two separate requirements files to manage the dependencies effectively.
